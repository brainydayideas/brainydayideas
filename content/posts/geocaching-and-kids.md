title: "5 Reasons Geocaching is Great for Kids"
---

My husband and I got into geocaching in 2006, a few years before our oldest was born. Since it's one of our favorite hobbies, our kids have been going along with us on geocaching outings their entire lives. If you;re not familiar with it, geocaching is an outdoor activity, where you use a GPS device (or smartphone app) to find hidden containers. The containers are called geocaches, and we've seen ones that range in size from less than half an inch tall to as large as a storage trunk.

The [Geocaching website](https://www.geocaching.com) has a description, attributes, the GPS coordinates, and sometimes hints for finding each geocache. You use that information to locate the geocache container in the real world. Once you find it, you sign the paper log inside with your geocaching username and log your find on the website as well.

### 1. Geocaching is an active, outdoor activity

One of the things I love the most about geocaching is that it gets us to go outside and explore as a family. Nearly anywhere you live, there probably are geocaches hidden nearby. A geocaching excursion can bring you to new places - from urban areas, to parks, to remote locations. Our kids especially enjoy finding geocaches while we're out on hikes.

### 2. It can break up long car rides

Geocaching has helped dramatically cut down on the dreaded "are we there yet?" complaints on road trips. When we are planning a long car ride, we look up a few geocaches along the way beforehand.

A quick stop to find a geocache gives us and the kids a chance to stretch our legs and a fun distraction.

We've found that combining geocaching with Pok√©mon GO can really turn around a case of the road trip grumpies.

### 3. Who doesn't love a treasure hunt?

If your kids are like mine, they love anything that resembles a treasure hunt. Many geocache containers, aside from the very small ones, have enough space inside for small toys or trinkets. Some geocachers enjoy trading items they find in geocaches. You'll sometimes hear these items referred to as geocaching SWAG. Proper ettiquette is to leave something if you take something. We carry a little bag of items with us, so that we always have something to leave if the kids find some SWAG they can't live without - like this fishing weight my daughter found in a cache near the beach.

Things like toy cars, foreign coins, and cute erasers make great geocaching swag. Avoid items that are edible, sharp, or that would get ruined if they got wet.

### 4. It's educational

Aside from the navigational skills they'll learn, geocaching can be used as a path to other learning as well.

[EarthCaches](http://www.geosociety.org/earthcache) are a type of cache that lead you to a special geological location. Instead of finding a phyiscal container, geocachers instead will learn facts about the unique geological features of that location and answer questions in order to mark the cache as "found".

We love EarthCaches and seek them out when we're on vacations or traveling to a new place as a family.

CITO (Cache In Trash Out) [events](https://www.geocaching.com/cito/default.aspx) can help kids learn about taking care of the environment as well as how to be part of their local community. At these events, you'll participate in activities like picking up litter, planting trees, pulling weeds, etc.

### 5. It's easy to get started

You don't need a bunch of equipment, time, or specialized knowledge to get started with Geocaching. A handheld GPS device or a smartphone with the [Geocaching app](https://www.geocaching.com/play/mobile) and a pen to sign the log are all the equipment you really need.
